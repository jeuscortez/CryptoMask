# Crypto Mask 
Crypto Mask is my Senior Project and first Android app.

It is an Android Application with the purpose of adding security and privacy to users' data. 

## Technlogies
It uses Cryptography and Steganography algorithms implemented with JAVA to secure images and text.

It also uses an SQLite Database to store some encryptions.

## Status
The Application has some bugs but it is functional. 

If time permits, I might come back to fix bugs and add comments to important functions.
